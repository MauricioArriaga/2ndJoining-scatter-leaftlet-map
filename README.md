# 2ndJoining-scatter-leaftlet-map
This was challenging to me, The embedded line place on the excercise did not work.
I reviewed carefully all the steps, as well as the Fix GitHub Code, I followed every step pointed that may cause problems, but nothing worked...
Then assumed that the <iframe> syntax was wrong, and I remembered that all the others embbeded files were generated by google or other tools, so I went to internet and found http://www.iframe-generator.com/.  I placed my URL and finally it generated an embedded proper syntax, that i was able to copy paste and make it run!.
